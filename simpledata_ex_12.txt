In order to convert from degrees fahrenheit to degrees celsius, we must first know the mathematical relationship between these values.

If the temperature is X (measured in deg F), then the temperature, Y (measured in deg F), would be:
					Y = (5/9)*(X - 32)

Therefore, our function could take the following form:

deg_fahrenheit = float( raw_input(“Temperature in fahrenheit? ”))
#we will convert to a float to avoid rounding
deg_celsius = float(degrees_fahrenheit - 32)*5/9
print “The temperature is “ + str(deg_celsius) + “degrees celsius.”
