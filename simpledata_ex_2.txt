The order of operations executed in the expression:

				2 + (3 - 1) * 10 / 5 * (2 + 3)

Since, by convention, we execute operations from left to right in the order parenthesis, (multiplication and division), then (addition and subtraction) the order is:

a subtraction    (3 - 1)  -> 2
an addition	 (2 + 3)  -> 5
a multiplication (2 * 10) -> 20
a division		 (20 / 5) -> 4
a multiplication (4 * 5)  -> 20
an addition	 (2 + 20) -> 22

This gives us our answer of 22.
